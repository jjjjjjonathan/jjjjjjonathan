### Hi there! I'm Jonathan (he/him).

I'm a dynamic full-stack web developer transitioning from a background in social media, journalism, and copy writing in the sports industry. In my 4+ years of working in semi-pro soccer, I felt a need for more robust tools to help create more accessibility for both audiences and creators, and to help share the multitude of stories across leagues, players, staff, and communities. With this drive to improve things for those around me, I learned the fundamentals of web development with Lighthouse Labs, focusing on JavaScript, Express, React, Rails, and more.

While I have less time for it now, I love writing feature stories. In the past, my articles have been published in League1 Ontario and the Football Chronicle (now defunct). If you'd like to check it out, I do have a [stories portfolio](https://www.clippings.me/jonathanmcheng)!
